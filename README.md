# Swift Code Challenges

This repository contains a collection of **code challenges** designed to complement the [Swift Structures](https://github.com/waynewbishop/SwiftStructures) project. These challenges provide practical applications of data structures and algorithms implemented in Swift, offering developers an opportunity to enhance their problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Features

The project includes solutions to popular coding challenges such as:

+ Reversing a Linked List
+ Validating a Palindrome
+ Finding the Longest Common Subsequence
+ Implementing Binary Search
+ Balancing a Binary Search Tree
+ Implementing Depth-First Search

## Getting Started

This project is optimized for **Swift 5.0** or later. The repository is organized as follows:
+ Challenges - Contains individual Swift files for each coding challenge
+ Tests - Unit tests to verify the correctness of challenge solutions

## Usage

Feel free to use these challenges for personal learning, interview preparation, or as teaching materials. Each challenge file includes a problem description, the solution implementation, and example usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new challenge, improve an existing solution, or fix a bug, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-challenges/pulls). Make sure to follow the existing code style and include appropriate tests.

## Questions and Feedback

If you have questions about the challenges or would like to provide feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-algorithms-challenges/issues) in this repository or [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waynebishop/) me directly.
